**Comparing different Recurrent Neural Networks performance on Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) dataset** 

In this study, different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based time-series forecasting algorithms are applied to the electric load data obtained from the Memorial University of Newfoundland. These algorithms include Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Network (GRU), Bi-GRU and Bi-LSTM. The data is trained on the previous week and its accuracy for the next day is measured using hourly forecasts. The accuracy of these algorithms is compared for day-ahead forecasting potential. Bi-GRU based RNN shows best performance among the tested algorithms with the highest R2 score and lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). 

The basic network architecture is given below:
